# Student & Todo Manager Project

## 📌 Overview
This project contains two main components:

1. **Student Class Example**  
   A simple demonstration of encapsulation in Python using private attributes and getter/setter methods.

2. **Todo Manager Application**  
   A task management system that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored persistently in a JSON file, making it a lightweight and easy-to-use personal task tracker.

### Todo Manager
- **Add tasks** with unique IDs.
- **View tasks** with completion status (✅ Completed / ❌ Not Completed).
- **Update tasks** (title or completion state).
- **Delete tasks** by ID.
- **Persistent storage** in `todos.json`.
